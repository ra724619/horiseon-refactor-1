# Project

horiseon-refactor-1

## Description
For this project, I have refactored the HTML and CSS for Horiseon, a marketing agency. It required the codebase that follows accessibility standards to optimise the site for search engines.

This project had taught me the usage of semantic HTML elements and amend CSS according to the change of HTML. Also I learned how to check the HTML and CSS file.

## Acceptance Criteria
There are 5 acceptance criteria for the accessibility standards. 
1/Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
2/HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3/Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
4/Heading attributes fall in sequential order
5/Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
